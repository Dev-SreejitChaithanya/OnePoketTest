# About 
This is a solution to NodeJS preliminary skill test for the company "OnePoket"


Task 1: Basic Node.js Server
Create a simple Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for all incoming HTTP requests. You can use any library or framework of your choice.

Task 2: Data Manipulation
Write a function in Node.js that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers.
